# IS-LM-Macroeconomic-Foundations-and-Dynamic-Parameter-Reflection
This repository contains the Prototype 0.1 implementation of the IS–LM equilibrium model + Neural Approximation + QQSS shock module.  The goal is not to provide a finished macro model, but to create a testbed for dynamic shock interactions and a neural surrogate for analytic IS–LM equilibrium.
